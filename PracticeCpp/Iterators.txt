An iterator is an object (like a pointer) that points to an element inside the container.
Iterators play a critical role in connecting algorithm with containers.
All iterators do not have similar functionality as that of pointers

Depending upon the functionality of iterators they can be classified into five categories.
	1. Input iterators
	2. Output iterators
	3. Forward iterators
	4. Bidirectional iterators
	5. Random Access iterators
