Member and Non-Member Begin and End

Member :
1. v.begin(), v.end()
2. Available for all collections in the library including vectory, string, map

Non-Member :
1. begin(v), end(v)
2. Calls v.begin() and v.end() if it exists
3. Works for C-Style arrays too
4. You can write a free function for a collection without member begin() and end()
5. The safest choice and good habit
