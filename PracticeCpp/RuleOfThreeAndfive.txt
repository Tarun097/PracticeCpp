When you choose to manage the memory yourself you should follow the so-called Rule of Three.
This rule states that if your class defines one or more of the following methods it should probably explicitly define all three:

	- destructor
	- copy constructor
	- copy assignment operator

Copy constructor is used to create a new object from another existing object.

	Holder h1(10000); // regular constructor
	Holder h2 = h1;   // copy constructor
	Holder h3(h1);    // copy constructor (alternate syntax)

Assignment operator, used to replace an existing object with another existing object.

	Holder h1(10000);  // regular constructor
	Holder h2(60000);  // regular constructor
	h1 = h2;           // assignment operator


Rule of Five :
It's an extension to the Rule of Three seen before.
It states that any class for which move semantics are desirable, has to declare two additional member functions:

	- move constructor — to construct new objects by stealing data from temporaries
	- move assignment operator — to replace existing objects by stealing data from temporaries
