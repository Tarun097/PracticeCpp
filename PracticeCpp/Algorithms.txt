Headers you should know

<algorithm>
<vector> <array> <list> <stack> <map> <queue>
<string>
<iterator>
<utility> <tuple>
<numeric>
<complex> <cmath>
<regex> <chrono>
<memory> - for smart pointers
<functional> - if you want to put method in variable and pass to collections


Algorithms :
	- Work on any container ( no matter what it contains )
	- They don't have to work on entire container, algorithms can just work on range (a part of container)
	- Typically work through iterators
	- Live in their own hear file <algorithm>, unless you include this hearder file you won't be able to use. They are not member functions of containers


Member or Nonmember Begin and End

Member :
	- v.begin(), v.end()
	- Available for all collections in the library including vector, string, map

Non-Member 
	- begin(v), end(v)
	- Calls v.begin() or v.end() if it exists
	- Works for C-Style arrays too
	- You can write a free function for a collection without member begin() and end()
	- The safest choice and a good habit
