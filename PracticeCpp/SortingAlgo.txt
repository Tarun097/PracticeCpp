Sorting algorithms :

	1. Bubble Sort
	2. Insertion Sort
	3. Selection Sort
	4. Quick sort
	5. Merge Sort
	6. Heap Sort
	7. Counting Sort
	8. Radix Sort

Classification of Sorting Algorithms :
	1. Based on Time Complexity 
				- rate of growth of time w.r.t input size
	2. Space Compelxity
				- In place, constant space
				- Memory grows with input size . ex : merge sort uses extra memory to temporarily store data and it grows with input size
	3. Stablity 
				-Sorting algorithm preserves the order after sort for same property on which sorting is performed
	4. Recursive vs Non-recursive
				- Merge & Quick sort are recursive
				- insertion and selection sort are non-recursive
