STL constists of 
	1. Algorithms
	2. Containers 
	3. Iterators   (interface between alogrithm and containers)

Containers are of following types:
	1. Sequence containers (implemented using arrays and linked list)
		ex: Array, vector, deque, list, forward_list

	2. Associative containers (implemented using binary tree - so items in containers are always sorted)
		ex: set, multiset, map, multimap
			Always sorted, default criteria is <
			No push_back(), push_front()


	3. Unordered associative containers (implemented using hash)
		ex: unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap
