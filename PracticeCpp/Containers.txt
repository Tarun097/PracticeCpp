STL constists of 
	1. Algorithms
	2. Containers 
	3. Iterators   (interface between alogrithm and containers)

Containers are of following types:
	1. Sequence containers (implemented using arrays and linked list)
		ex: Array, vector, deque, list, forward_list
		Array - if the collection never grows or shrinks

		These containers don't have find() as it takes O(n)
		Data is arranged in sequential manner , so Sequence Containers

	2. Associative containers (implemented using binary tree - so items in containers are always sorted)
		ex: set, multiset, map, multimap
			Always sorted, default criteria is <
			No push_back(), push_front() as elemets are sorted and such functions will break the order

			Called associative because of map : key is "associated" with value, 
			                                    for set (value itself is key) value of element identifies it and each value must be unique

			These have find() : takes O(log(n))
			Have erase() by value too

			set\multiset elements are read-only , cannot be modified- can be added or delete
			*itr = 10; //not allowed as this may corrupt the order

			set\multiset properties :
				fast search : O(log(n))
				traversing is slow compared to  vector and deque
				No random access , no [] operator
				elements are sorted according to value of element (value acts as key here)

			map\multimap properties:
				elements are sorted by keys



	3. Unordered associative containers (implemented using hash)
		ex: unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap

		Properties of unordered containers :
			1. Fastest search\insert at any place : O(1)
				Associative containers take O(log(n))
				vectors, deque takes O(n)
				list take O(1) to insert, O(n) to search
			2. Unordered set\multiset : element value cannot be changed
			   Unordered map\multimap : element key cannot be changed

 Container Adapters :
		- Provide a restricted interface to meet special needs
		- Implemented with fundamental container classes

		1. stack : LIFO, push(), pop(), top()
		2. queue : FIFO, push_back(), pop_front(), front(), back()
		3. priority_queue : first item always has the greatest priority
							push(), pop(), top()


 Another way of categorizing containers:
	1. Array-based containers : vector, deque
	2. Node-based containers : list + associative containers + unordered containers

	Array based containers invalidates pointers:
		- Native pointers, iterators, references

		ex:
			vector<int> vec = {1,2,3,4};
			int* p = &vec[2]; //p points to 3
			vec.insert(vec.begin(),0);
			cout << *p << endl;  // 2 or ? -- undefined behaviour after insert\erase operation
